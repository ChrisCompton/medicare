#' @title medicare: tools for simplifying Medicare data analysis
#' @name medicare
#'   
#' @description The medicare package contains useful functions for manipulating
#'   raw Medicare public use files. These sometimes come with SAS read-in code
#'   provided, but more frequently require the analyst to manually recode and
#'   rename variables based on thorough review of the data documentation. This
#'   package focuses mostly on Cost Reports and Provider of Service files, but
#'   more support will be added for other sources in the future.
